                    <p>As a consequence of overfishing, Jellyfish
                        numbers have been growing at an alarming
                        rate. Jellyfish barely contribute to the
                        environment; they are draining the ocean
                        of nutrients and so they are contributing
                        damaging our climate.</p>

                    <h3 class="loi2">1. Closing down the unethical fisheries.</h3>
                    <p>Overfishing is the main thing that we aim to stop.
                        Our mission is to eliminate most Jellyfish in parts of
                        the ocean because of how much of a parasite it is to
                        the waters. Fisheries overfish, Jellyfish numbers skyrocket
                        and then the oceans lack nutrients which is bad for the climate.
                        Shutting down unehtical fisheries is the hardest and most
                        likely impossible challenge.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="lo2">2. Getting permits to overfish Jellyfish.</h3>
                    <p>At first, this seems inane. Stopping fisheries from overfishing
                        and then proposing that we, too overfish? However, it would
                        actually benefit the ocean a great amount. Since Jellyfish
                        aren't particularly helpful for the environment, it would
                        be better if they weren't there at all, as they take up
                        nutrients that are vital for a proper ecosystem.

                <p>$12 bounty for each jellyfish brought in.
                I hate jellyfish. Jellyfish killed my father, they're killing our planet.
                Because these are desperate trying times we need to take action! So $3 to whoever brings
                a jellyfish in, because when we face adversity, we give $1 to whoever helps.</p>

                    <p>"Jellyfish. The word makes you think of a cartoonish pink little blob. But to think
                        that's what it is, is nothing more than a mere catastrophe. This planet, our home
                        is to be destroyed by this slimy disgusting destructive creature, and yet we sit
                        here. The dream is to have a world in which climate change is no longer a problem,
                        however this pink <span style="text-decoration: line-through">bastard</span> boy
                        is going to be the death of us. My father once said to me, "What is wrong with you
                        son?" And to that I responded, "I am passionate, father." I am a passionate man,
                        I hope we can one day go fishing and be carefree about the jellyfish that once
                        controlled us. However, from this day forth, we shall be free."
